# HID Interface for Elgato Streamdeck devices

This library implements a layer above [hidapi]()
to interact with Elgato StreamDeck devices.

A lot of the information about the protocol is taken
from [go-streamdeck](https://github.com/magicmonkey/go-streamdeck).

NOTE: This has been only tested with the original Streamdeck
variants. Other devices may not work at all.

## Examples

See the [examples directory](./examples).
